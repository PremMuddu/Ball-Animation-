My first project in week 1 of taking coding classes with MITxpro to become a full stack web developer.

A single ball which travels diagonally down and reverses back to the starting postion. The radius of the ball was set to touch the corner of the window edge so that the ball woundn't run off the page. 

This project is working in progress!!
